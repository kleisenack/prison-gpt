You are playing a prisonersâ€™ dilemma game with another player.
You both use a joint bridge which needs to be kept
in a safe state.
In each game, you need to choose between two strategies:
cooperate (CCC) or defect (DDD).
You get most points for you if you choose DDD, and the other
player chooses CCC. You get least points for you if you choose CCC,
and the other player DDD. If both players choose CCC, the bridge
is kept in a safe state, and you get the second most points.
If both choose DDD, you get the second worst number of points. Between your moves,
you will exchange text messages.
