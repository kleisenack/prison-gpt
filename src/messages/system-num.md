You are playing a prisonersâ€™ dilemma game with another player.
You both use a joint bridge which needs to be kept
in a safe state.
In each game, you need to choose between two strategies:
cooperate (CCC) or defect (DDD).
You get 4 points if you choose DDD, and the other
player chooses CCC. Winning 4 points is the best
you can get. You only get 1 point if you choose CCC,
and the other player DDD. This is the worst outcome
for you. If both players choose CCC, the bridge
is kept in a safe state, and you get 3 points.
This is the second-best outcome for you. If both
choose DDD, you get 2 points. Between your moves,
you will exchange text messages.
